Commit III  14NOV2010
Discovered a bug where Latex has a buffer overrun, fixed using a latex command that forces latex to place stuff before it gets to the end of the document, changed template to accomplish this

Completed the database, all of romans is in the database.

My first commit, not quite sure how this works, but here goes

I made changes in every file, adjusted the templates a little here and there, and added romans chapters 1-4 to the data base

Finally, I may have made perl cry but to get the formatting to work correctly I added some Latex commands into the variable declarations for the week days.  This allows me to manually set the height of each day without modifying any other chunk of code.
